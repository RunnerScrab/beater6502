Summary
------------------------------------------------

Test code / schematics for a breadboarded 6502 computer very similar
to the Ben Eater 6502 computer, but with:

	* a differently apportioned address space/decoding circuitry
	* a UART + FT232R USB interface
	* a smaller ROM (8 KiB)
	* a different SRAM brand (pin compatible, slightly different timing)
	* 4-bit communication with the LCD module (only 7 pins on VIA port B are required)

Address Space
-------------------------------------------------
0000-7FFF RAM
8000-9FFF VIA (a beefy peripheral interface chip)
A000-BFFF ACIA (UART)
C000-DFFF unassigned
E000-FFFF ROM
